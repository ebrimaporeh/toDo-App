# toDo-App
This project aims to build a feature-rich To-Do app to help users manage tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, delete, and organise tasks with categorization, due dates, and priorities. The app will have a React frontend and a Django REST API backend to provide persistent storage and robust task management.
